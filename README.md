# RAG examples using Langchain. 
### Influenced by the short course *LangChain Chat with Your Data* from **DeepLearning.AI**.
Visit https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/langchain-chat-with-your-data.

This notebook starts with experiments with RAG systems.

At the end of the notebook there is the possibility of having a conversation with a chatbot powered with documents that allows users to see in depth the chunks retrieved as well as its metadata.

#### **Note**:
 - **A *.env* file must exist at the root of the directory and it must have the appropriate values (OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-XXXX...") for the correct functioning of the app.**
 - **Use the *requirements.txt* or *environmnet.yml* file in the *requirements* folder for installing the Python packages.**
 - **The Python version is 3.11.0.**
 - **Conda 24.1.2 was used for the generation of the environment and the development of the app.**
 - **This work is part of my Master's Thesis.**
